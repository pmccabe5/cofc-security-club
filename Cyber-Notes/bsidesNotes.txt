            Rules for breaking rules
                Break a rule a day
                Getting out of trouble is a muscle
                Never break a rule you cannot accept the consequences
                Don't break a rule where someone else pays the consequences
                Tell someone what you are doing
        Stress:
            Embrace it

    5 Things That Matter
        The beginning
            We're still finding our way, butgetting better
            Still havent been replaced by AI
            Top 5 things that matter in security
            "Everything is broken"
            Harder to challenge the norm, make things better
            We are getting better and maturing as an industry
            Not everything is broken
        Basics
            Weka passwords, 2FA, segmentation, app whitelisting
            Not an easy fix and takes time
            Programs designed to try and handle evrything
            See photo
            Windows Firewall, Endpoint logs
            Purchase tools = fix poor programs & lack of leadership
            Executive buy-in, mismanagement and leadership, or infancy in security
            Some further ahead of others
            Collaboration = harder to attack, better practice
        Simuations and Emmulations
            Tools releases are great simulations
            Without, red/blue can't understand each other
            Working through identifying gaps in programs help put priority on what really matters
            Smash & destroy history from pen testers from 10 years ago
            Industry change happened
        Collaboration and Sharing
            Info sharing
            Concerns about crowdsourced TTPs
            Some red teams do their own research and customize tooling to compete
            Research is a good thing
            Releasing tools is a good thing
        Behavior
            Techniques, not tactics and procedures
            Too many false positives
            Allocation of appropriating resources for detection
            Protection takes time 
            Detection vs. Protection
            Visibility is first step
            Must include endpoint logs
            Break out - 1.5 hours
        People, Leadership, & Communication
            Isn't easy
            People are the most important security resource
            Selling ourselves, our value, & strategy isn't easy
            Investments that need to do our jobs is tough
            Tougher when we say no
        If you can't make a change, move on

    History of Least Privilege -Unix
        Basics

BSIDES Charleston (2019):
	Keynote:
		Project 0: RE
		Pick your side
			Red
				use offensive tactics & pov
				Types
					pentest
					social engineering
					vuln research: patch & fix
					adversary simulation: pentest type, model after attack vector (script-kiddie, organized crime, nation-state, etc.)
					exploit development
			Blue
				protect organization and devices
				Types:
					SecOPS
					Malware Analysis
					Threat Intel
					IR
					Digital Forensice
			Identity
				Drawn to Red
					more tangible goals
					makes problems
				Drawn to Blues
					more real
					wait
					solves problems
			Simplification of the other side, forced dichotomy
			Same goal
			Red helps blue
			Persistence
			Blue helps Red
				Scripting/tooling
			Communication, Teamwork
	Medical Records & Default Passwords:
		Rooms, schedues, medical devices
		displays for patient info
		help figure out patient room & doctor, code blue --> internal network
		doctors connect in through VPN
		no segmentation
		electronic medical records
		HL7: encoding, not hashing
			compatibility between devices, plaintext
		Healthcare Defaults
			museadmin:MuseAdmin
			museBkgnd:MuseBkgd
			can't change password because someone can die or knock something down
			Citrix/VPN valid
		Unauthenticated VNC
		Unatuthorized access to ePHI
			NFS: new file system
		Password Manager is a must
			passwords.txt/excs
		Physical records
		Duplicates count 1:1
		OCR Breach Portal
			>500: immediate
			<= 499: at the end of the year
		HIPAA
			pentest if reasonable
		HITRUST Framework
			small: level 1
			medium: level 2
			big: level 3
			measures lots of stuff
		FHIR
			RESTful APIs
		Crown Jewels
			ePHI
				webcams
			ePHI/PHI (physical pen test)
				printers, fax, copiers
				trash cans
				NICU/ICU/ER publically visible
		Listen to problems
	Dr. X:
		Why security metrics?
			if you can't measure it, you cannot improve it
			objective
			What makes a good metric
				Quantitative
				Objective
				Repeatable & reproducible
				Inexpensive
				Universally acceptable
			Measuring security is difficult
				Time to apply latest patch
				Time until compromised
			Landscape is complicated
				IOT Security Landscape
		Prior work on metrics for Security
			2008
				CIA, economic, framework, reliability
				target
				assumptions
				validation
			2016
				vulnerability
				defense
			Attack Graphs
				hops to asset
			Simulations
			Security Metrics- Federal
				NIST-CVSS 3.0
				ISO/IEC - 27004:2016
			Security Metrics- Industry
				Books
			Challenge
				Scope
				Standardization
				Verification
				Politics...
		Framework
			IOT Threat Model
			IOT Challengesow
				Compute
				Memory
				Battery
				Sensors
				Actuators
			Areas of focus
				Know thy self
				Know the enemy
				Know the metric
			IOT taxonomy
				Organize
				Prove
				Apply
			Device Characteristics
			Models of IOT operation
				Blaine's research
			Adversarial modeling
				When
				How
				after how long, your system will be compromised
				measure the adversary's skill
			Metrics for IOT security

	Maltego:
		OSINT
			Open Source
			publicly available
			part of the recon process
			Passive vs. Active
				Passive = legal
				active = grey area, can be base
		Why?
			Sales leads, marketing info
			Footprint a network
			Gain insight for what information is publicl available
			Business preventing sensitive data leakage
			Law enforcement
		Problems in the process
			Volumes of data
			Organization of data
			Reliability of data
				who-----\
						 |---> data comes from
				where---/
		What is it?
			Data aggregation tool
			Java based
			APIs of various sources
			Graphs using relationships and data points
			CE
		Important terms
			Entities
				specific nodes on the graph
				manual/automatically added
				pivot point for additinal transforms
				don't forget about detail view
			Transforms
				utilizes data from an entity to pivot an find additional info
				usually done with API calls
				remote vs local
				transforms can be added through hubs
			Views
				look @ data
				block, hierarchical, circular, organic
					weight of entity determines position
			Machines
				utiizes multiple entities and transforms to automate process
				can use built in machines or mae your own
				simple automation or larger custom scripts 
			Collections- simplifies large number of entities
			Privacy mode- normal vs stealth
			Import/Exports, copy/paste entities
		Machine creation
	Cyber Security --> Business:
		Problems
			comm with leaders
			resource allocation
		Anything can be made into an IOT
		5G
			hasten growth of attack surface
			hackers can exploit the ubiquitous 5G security lag
		Risk is the rosetta stone of cyber-cXo relations
			speak in terms of $$
		Deliver consistent data on risk
