			XSS (Persistent)
			Buffer Overflow (@stephen)
		OSINT 
			Linkedin

			Githubs
		Documentation 
			Screenshots
			Logger script
		Reporting
			Good report startegy, divide and conquer approach worked really well
			Business impact
			Regulations
	The Bad
		Website taken down
		Not scanning device
		Reached out for 11/12 subnets
		Go to Tom for the .250 thing
		Keep tracks with OSINT
		Enumeration/Exploitation
			improve knowledge of exploits
			GET THE RANGE UP 
		Drive organization/gameplan 

	What needs clarification:
		10.0.11.0/24 & 10.0.12.0/24???
	Next Time:
		Check appendix
		Get email confirmation of moves/change of scope
		Organization- good but could be better
		Different vulnerability scanners
		Research and make up experience
		Sample reporting
