    What is pentesting?
        Subjective
        Different company = different meaning
        Sell the customer about what you can do
        **pentest-standard.org
        Vulnerability Scanning- scan to report (monthly)
        Penetration Test- known testing, scan more of the network (ex nmap), find vulnerabilities, exploit, & demonstrate risk (every year or so)
        Red Team Assesment- they don't know your coming and objective is established, full on adversarial simulation engagements can be long term, and use long term advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (specific targets) (lets see what happens)
            test chain of command and incidence response
       Back office/documentation
        scoping calls- what is in bounds, used for compliance (get Tom on the phone)
            how many ips
            what is the objective (root, group of users, domain admin)
            defenses (maturity of these defenses ex: CSOC, firewall)
            objective (pricing can vary)
            timing
        Master Service agreement (MSA)
            Used to define business will be conducted between two businesses
            Commonly include
                payment terms
                insurance
                liability
        Scope of Work 
            Rules of engagement
                dates/times (testing blackouts)
                systems not aloowed to be tested on
                attacks that cannot be carried out
            Defines:
                services
                scope
                rules of engagement (when is testing allowed)
                Requirements needed from both parties

    Pentesting Methodology
        Information Gathering
            Passive/Active
                Passive: OSINT model (packets don't touch the network) 
                Active: packets are sent to the newtork (nmap, masscan, netcat, telnet)      
            Asset Enummeration
                nmap
                    nmap -sn -iL targets.ip -oA output
                        sn: ping scan
                        -iL: input from file
                        -oA: outputs into multiple formats
                set up log box
                could use body cams...
            Organization Ennumeration
            
            Service Ennumeration
                nmap
                    nmap -sS --top-pars 200 --open -iL targets.txt -oA top200services stealth
                        -sS: syn scan
                        --top-ports <ports>: only scan ports 1-200 
                        --open: only show open ports
                    nmap -sT --top-pars 200 --open -iL targets.txt -oA top200services stealth
                        -sT: full connection scan
                        -Pn: just start sending packets, can be useful with firewalls
                        --script=<script>: use nmap script
                masscan
                    masscan <ip> -p startport, endport -oG mass_update --rate 10000
                        -p: ports
                        -oG: output to grepable file
                        ---rate: rate at which it runs, BE CAREFUL with the number

        Threat Modeling
            take data and analyze assets, services, and technologies
            resources:
                exploit-db.com
                cve.mitre.org
                others
        Vulnerability Analysis
            Hand in hand with threat modeling
            Attack chains
                set aside pentesting apart from basic vulnerability analysis
                chaining pieces togetherto perform a full attack
        Exploitation
            exploit attacks that have occurred already
            exploit code on the internet
            metasploit
                all in one
                take nmap scan and feed into db
                exploitation
                post exploitation
        Post Exploitation
            start enumerating the machine
                users (/etc/passwd)
                os version
                files
                    /home
                    ssh keys
                other things? /etc/hosts, any *.cfg, history, try not to keep persistance (depends on the engagement), /etc/shadow, sensitive data, source code
        Reporting
            hands off the keyboard if theres illegal data on the machine
            don't continue if there's a glaring exploit
            executive summary: for the higher ups
            detailed summary: all the exploits and vulnerabilities that need to be patched
            know thier business process
