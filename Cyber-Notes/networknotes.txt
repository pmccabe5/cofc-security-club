10/9: Workshop 2, Dr. X
	NCL Gym open
	Djikstra's Algorithm
	Top to bottom 
	CSCI440
	Internet
		hosts- end systems
		run net apps
		Communication Links
			Cables, radios, satellites
			Transmission bandwith
			Packet switches- forward packets
				routers and switches
		IOT
			vunerable out of the box
			More devices = more attack surface
		Internet- networks of networks
		protocols- control the sending/receiving of the messages
		Standards
			RFC- request for comments (854)
			IETF- Internet Engineering Task Force
		Infrastructure that provides services to appliations
		provides programming interface ...
	OSI vs TCP stacks
		OSI
			L7 Application (web browser)
			L6 Presentation(interpret meanng of data, encoding/decoding)
			L5 Session(synchornization)
			L4 Link(LAN, ARP)
			L3 Network
			L2 Data Link
			L1 Physical
		TCP
			L5 Application
			L4 Transport
			L3 Network
			L2 Link
			L1 Physical
	Wireshark
		Select interface and then capture
		Traceroute- path to IP
		Network Interface Card
	Network Structure
		Bunch of access networks
		Doesn't scale O(n^2)
		Google is an ISP in and of itself
		Ex: Sprint
	Layer
		5 Application (DNS)
			Web and HHTP
				webpage consists of objects 
				HTML file which includes several references
				host/path
				HTTP
					Client-server model
						Client- browser that requests/receives
						Server- Sends objects
					Uses TCP (80/80:80/HTTPS443)
					GET/POST/HEAD
						Header lines
						crriage returns
					Versions
						1.0
						1.1
					Responses
						200 good
						301 moves
						400
						404
						505
		4 Transport vs network
			logical communication between ports
			routers L3
			reliable- TCP (Proto 6)
			unreliable- UDP (Proto 17)
			logical ports for apps
			UDP (non-HD videos) 
		3 Network
			best path
			could be congested 
			forwarding and routing
				routing algorithms
				queues...
				1064 byte max
			IP addresses
				CIDR notation
				subnet mask
					logical and
				darknet- blackhole with no hosts
