Pen tester report
OSCP take notes of what your doing
Security analysis (potential impact w/ pros/cons)
Phases of Unknown Environment:
Know it
	Boundary of Scope
		Scoring
		Infrastructure
		Other Teams
	Don't nmap everything
		Time
		Wasted info
		Infrastructure
Ennumerate
	nmap/mass scan network/subnet
	Maltego + OSINT
Strengths/weaknesses
	Webapp pentesting
	DB pentesting
	OS Knowledge
	Primary/secondary
	Point of Access (cmd injection lateral movement)
Roles:
	Scanning
	Webapp pentest
	Password Cracking
	OSINT
	Burpsuite/OWASP zap
	Vulnrability hunting
		Server type (Distro/kernel) + exploits
	Privilege escalation
	nvdb
Don't focus on specific tools per say
	possible tool restriction
	concept to different tools

Focus on:
	IPV6
	Trust who you arrive
	How to patch/fix
	CVE
	2 choices for mitigation
	IR Reports (Sans Reading Room) (Document Sources)
	GItKraken (Pro w/ .edu)
	Automate CVE Search w/ python
	RE/code analysis
	Object desterilization
	Backups	(Win/linux + safe storage) look for tick at the end of the file 
	Window Group Policy, Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
Crackable passwords or uncrackable (10 min time limit)

Jason Damron:
	How to fix and how to test same vulnerability
	Find something bad, notify authority IMMEDIATELY
	NDA- common, read to see what it covers and cannot disclose any information gained on engagement
		Possible Engineering aspect after engagement time ends, talk about afterwards
		Don't talk about tactics outside environment
	Report 
	RFP- keep good notes during the competition, screenshots 
	Financial regulaions knowledge
	In terms of money
	Triage, notes, & screenshots
	Impact, what we did, & remidiation
	Discussion @ end, time limited engagement, extrapolate findings
	Legality
		Scope- what is allowed to be tested/scored, watch what your scanning, can we touch it?, know if you are in-bounds 
		Ownership- client owns what is being scanned, no DDOS, ask permision to scan all systems?
	Keep track of your tracks
	Starting Point:
		O(bserve)o(rient)d(ecide)a(ct) loops
			Scan
			Identify targets 
			Divide & conquer
			exploit & make $$$ 
	Azure most likely, IOT could be used
	Research CVE's/ExploitDB
	OpenVAS(Neil), OWASP Zap, Metasploit, maltego, nmap, hashcat, netcat, responder(Neil), burpsuite, dirb/dirbuster
	AD*(Stephen & Dilyara)- bloodhound, PowerShellEmpire+mimikatz(Dilyara), Powersploit, responder(neil) (MITM)
	Report- direct and to the point but, elaborate a little on why it's important
		Failed attacks also important to document 
	Blockchain vulnerable to something
	byt3bl33d3r
	Phone app APIs?
	Refer to Tom for further inquiries
Ryan Hays:
	Research exploits and don't knock down stuff
	Screenshots
	Known vulnerability: find all but don't 
	Defcon crypto videos
	Standard C2
		Send shell to everyone
		Metasploit
		Powershell loaders
		Scan and upload to google drive
		don't all scan at once
		no stealth during assesment
		no compliance for the report, but for executive report
		pass the hash- look for local hashes
			crackmapexec
		username compisition
		malware somewhere
			exploit development
			downoad custom application
		look for apps without password timeout
			try not to bruteforce
		IOT possibility
			AC
			Printers (AD credentials)
			Cameras
		responder
			ARP authentication
		use kiwi is new (creds all)
			mimikatz metasploit
		DBs with credentials
		pentest monkey
